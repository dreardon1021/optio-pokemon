# Original 150 Pokedex!

This project was a learning experience as it was my first time using Apollo, GQL. This was also my first time developing a TypeScript app from scratch. Most of the time on this 15 hour project was spent learning GQL/Apollo and battling typescript errors. This was a great experiment for me as I brought together all of the things I have learned during my time at Mintbean!

For development, Pull down this repo and in your terminal, do 'yarn start'
